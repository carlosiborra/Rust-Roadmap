## [1. Handling Command-Line Arguments](1.Handling%20Command-Line%20Arguments/)

This is an example of how to handle command-line arguments in Rust. It's a simple program that takes a series of numbers as arguments and prints the gdc of all of them.

### How to run

In order to run a normal executable, you need to run the following command:

```bash
cargo run 2 4 6 8 10
```

In order to run the tests, you need to run the following command:

```bash
cargo test
```
